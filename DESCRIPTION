Description: 
    R package for easy mapping of orthologous genes across a wide variety of species. 
    orthogene uses homologene to pull up-to-date interspecies gene orthologs mappings across 20+ species.
    It also provides various utility functions to map common objects (e.g. gene expression matrices)
    onto gene orthologs from another species.
